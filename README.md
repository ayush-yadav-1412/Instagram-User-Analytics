## Queries and Results

### Marketing Queries

1. **Rewarding the Most Loyal Users**
   ```sql
   SELECT *
   FROM users
   ORDER BY created_at
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: Users with id 80, 67639538 are the 5 oldest users of Instagram.

2. **Remind Inactive Users to Start Posting**
   ```sql
   SELECT users.username AS Username, Photos.id
   FROM users
   LEFT JOIN photos ON users.id = photos.user_id
   WHERE photos.id IS NULL;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: The mentioned users didnâ€™t post any photos (photo_id is NULL).

3. **Declaring Contest Winner**
   ```sql
   SELECT
   username,
   photos.id AS Photo_ID, photos.image_url, COUNT(*) AS Total_likes
   FROM photos
   INNER JOIN likes ON likes.photo_id = photos.id
   INNER JOIN users ON photos.user_id = users.id
   GROUP BY photos.id
   ORDER BY Total_likes DESC
   LIMIT 1;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: Photo_ID 145 by user Zack_Kemmer93 received the most likes.

4. **Hashtag Researching**
   ```sql
   SELECT tag_name, COUNT(tag_name) AS total_tag_usage
   FROM tags
   INNER JOIN photo_tags ON tags.id = photo_tags.tag_id
   GROUP BY tags.id
   ORDER BY total_tag_usage DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: The most used hashtags are smile, beach, party, fun, and concert.

5. **Launch AD campaign**
   ```sql
   SELECT dayname(created_at) AS Day, count(*) AS total_registration
   FROM users
   GROUP BY Day
   ORDER BY total_registration DESC
   LIMIT 2;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: Most user registrations occur on Thursday and Sunday.

### Investor Metrics Queries

1. **User Engagement**
   ```sql
   SELECT
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos) / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users) AS AVG_photo_upload;
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: The average number of photos uploaded by a user is 2.57.

2. **Bots & Fake accounts**
   ```sql
   SELECT users.id, username, COUNT(users.id) AS total_likes_given_by_user
   FROM users
   INNER JOIN likes ON users.id = likes.user_id
   GROUP BY users.id
   HAVING total_likes_given_by_user = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photos);
   ```
   - **Conclusion**: The mentioned users liked every single photo.
